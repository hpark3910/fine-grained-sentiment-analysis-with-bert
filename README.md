# yelp-sentiment-analysis-with-bert
This project uses BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for Yelp sentiment analysis. For sentiment classification based on BERT, I used the cross entropy loss. For sentiment regression based on BERT, I used the 1) MSE loss, 2) Smooth L1 loss, and 3) masked Smooth L1 loss.
